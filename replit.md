# واصل - Wasel Food Delivery System

## Project Overview
A comprehensive food delivery system supporting three user roles: Customers, Drivers, and Administrators. Built as a full-stack TypeScript application with a React frontend and Express backend.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, TanStack Query, Wouter routing
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL, WebSockets (ws), Passport.js auth
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Replit managed), Drizzle ORM schema in `/shared/schema.ts`
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Build Tool**: Vite (frontend) + esbuild (backend)

## Project Structure
- `/client` - React frontend application
  - `/src/pages` - Pages organized by role: admin, driver, customer
  - `/src/components` - Reusable UI components (Shadcn UI based)
  - `/src/context` - React Context providers (Auth, Cart, Location, Theme)
- `/server` - Express backend
  - `index.ts` - Entry point
  - `db.ts` - DatabaseStorage class (Drizzle ORM)
  - `storage.ts` - IStorage interface + MemStorage fallback
  - `routes/` - Modular API routes (admin, driver, orders, etc.)
  - `viteServer.ts` - Vite dev server integration
  - `seed.ts` - Default data seeding
- `/shared` - Shared code (Drizzle schema, types)
- `/drizzle` - Migration files

## Driver App Audit Fixes (Session 2)
- **EnhancedDriverDashboard.tsx**: CRITICAL fix — replaced broken `WS_MANAGER` polling with a dedicated WebSocket connection for the driver app (independent of customer WS). Driver now correctly authenticates and receives real-time notifications
- **EnhancedDriverDashboard.tsx**: Removed `activeTab` from WebSocket `useEffect` dependency array (was causing WS reconnect on every tab switch). Used `activeTabRef` pattern instead to avoid stale closures
- **EnhancedDriverDashboard.tsx**: Added `driverWsRef` to share WS reference with geolocation effect (for location update sends)
- **ProfilePage.tsx**: Now fetches fresh profile data from `/api/drivers/app/dashboard` server endpoint (was only reading stale localStorage data set at login time)
- **CustomerAuthPage.tsx**: Implemented real Google Sign-In using Google Identity Services (GIS) SDK. When `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` env var is set, renders Google's official button and decodes real JWT to get `sub`, `email`, `name`. Falls back to clear error if unconfigured. Apple login keeps existing flow.

## Google Sign-In Setup (To Activate)
1. Create a project in Google Cloud Console and enable "Google Identity" API
2. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Web application type)
3. Add your Replit app URL to authorized origins
4. Set `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable with your client ID
5. The Google Sign-In button in `/auth` will automatically activate

## Session 3: Guest/Auth Cleanup, Login Fix, HomePage Cache
- **Login bug fix** (`server/routes/auth.ts`): Login identifier and registration username/phone/email are now trimmed of whitespace and Arabic-Indic digits are converted to Latin. Login matches against both raw and whitespace-stripped forms.
- **Guest order auto-deletion** (`server/db.ts`): Added `deleteOrderAndAssociated(orderId)` helper. In `completeOrder`, when an order has `customerId IS NULL` (guest), the order, its tracking, ratings, driver reviews/commissions, wallet/loyalty transactions, support tickets, messages, coupon usages, and notifications are deleted ~15 seconds after delivery (giving the UI a moment to show "delivered").
- **Guest wasalni auto-deletion** (`server/routes/wasalni.ts`): Same immediate-delete behavior applied to wasalni requests when `status='delivered'` and `customerId IS NULL`.
- **Logged-in tracking deletion warning** (`server/index.ts`): Hourly cleanup now sends a `order_tracking_deletion_warning` notification to logged-in customers (`customerId IS NOT NULL`) ~24h after a terminal order, exactly 1 day before the existing 2-day cleanup deletes the order. Idempotent: skips if a warning was already sent. The warning notification is excluded from the 24h notification cleanup so the customer can see it before the order itself is deleted at +48h.
- **HomePage data persistence** (`client/src/lib/queryClient.ts`): Bumped `gcTime` from 5min → 1hr so cached query data isn't garbage-collected after the user navigates to Profile/Orders and stays there. Added `placeholderData: (prev) => prev` to keep stale data visible during background refetch (no more empty/flicker when returning to HomePage).

## Recent Fixes Applied (Comprehensive Audit)
- Fixed `eq import` error in `server/index.ts` scheduled orders timer
- Fixed admin/driver login routing in `AuthContext.tsx` and `LoginPage.tsx`
- **Cart.tsx**: Fixed post-order redirect from broken `/order-tracking/:id` → correct `/orders/:id`
- **App.tsx**: Added missing routes: `/favorites` (Favorites), `/wasalni` (WasalniPage), `/category/:name` (CategoryPage)
- **OrderTracking.tsx**: Added WebSocket auth messages (userId + customerPhone), added auto-reconnect, added working cancel order button via `PATCH /api/orders/:id/cancel`
- **CustomerAuthPage.tsx**: Fixed social login using wrong localStorage key (`token` → `auth_token`)
- **auth.ts**: Added `isActive` field to `/api/auth/validate` response; added isActive check to block inactive users
- **admin.ts**: Added targeted `sendToUser` + `sendToDriver` calls in `PUT /api/admin/orders/:id/status` in addition to broadcast, ensuring customer gets direct WS notification when driver is assigned
- **NotificationContext.tsx**: Now listens for both `order_update` AND `order_status_changed` WS types; sends auth for both user.id and customer_phone; added Arabic status labels for notifications
- **socket.ts**: Fixed missing `isAlive` field in client entries on auth

## Key Auth Pattern
- Customer auth token stored as `auth_token` in localStorage = user UUID
- Admin: `admin_token`, Driver: `driver_token`
- Customer phone stored in `customer_phone` localStorage key
- WS auth sends both userId (UUID) and phone to cover all targeting patterns

## Driver Earnings Bug Fix (Critical)
**Bug**: Driver wallet balance was being doubled on order completion (e.g., 3000 earned → 6000 added).
**Root Cause**: In `server/db.ts` `completeOrder()`, both `updateDriverBalance()` AND `createDriverCommission()` (which internally calls `createDriverTransaction()` which calls `updateDriverBalance()` again) were called for the same amount.
**Fix Applied**:
1. `completeOrder()` (db.ts): Removed direct `updateDriverBalance()` call - now only `createDriverCommission()` handles the balance update chain
2. `add-balance` route (advanced.ts): Removed extra `updateDriverBalance()` call - now only `createDriverTransaction()` updates the balance  
3. Withdrawal approval route (advanced.ts): Same fix - removed duplicate `updateDriverBalance()` call

## Restaurant Financial Statement
- **API**: `GET /api/restaurant-accounts/:restaurantId/statement?from=&to=` - returns detailed order-by-order breakdown with commission, net earnings, and withdrawal history
- **UI Page**: `client/src/pages/admin/RestaurantStatementPage.tsx` - full-featured statement with period filter, summary cards, detailed order table, withdrawal history, print, and PDF download (jsPDF + autoTable)
- **Navigation**: Added "تقرير PDF" button in `AdminRestaurantAccounts.tsx` next to each restaurant
- **Route**: `/admin/restaurant-accounts/:restaurantId/statement`

## Real-time Dashboard Updates
- Admin Dashboard (`AdminDashboard.tsx`): Added WebSocket listener for instant invalidation on order/notification events, reduced polling to 15 seconds
- Driver Dashboard: Already had WebSocket + added wasalni query invalidation
- Customer Notifications Panel: Added WebSocket for real-time notification refresh
- Added GPS location auto-fill (Nominatim reverse geocoding) to WasalniPage steps 1 & 2
- Added conditional coupon field in CartPage based on `coupon_min_order_value` setting
- Added `coupon_min_order_value` to seed.ts and AdminUiSettings admin panel
- Removed hard location requirement from cart checkout button (order can be placed without GPS)
- Fixed React invalid hook call and setState-in-render warning in App.tsx

## Latest Session Fixes (April 2026)
- **Targeted notifications (server/socket.ts)**: New `notifyOrder(type, payload, recipients)` helper sends WebSocket events only to the specific customer (by id and phone), assigned driver, admin dashboard, and active order trackers. Replaced all global `ws.broadcast('order_update', ...)` calls in `server/routes/orders.ts`, `server/routes/wasalni.ts`, `server/routes/driver.ts`, and one in `server/routes/admin.ts` with `ws.notifyOrder(...)` so each customer only receives their own order updates.
- **TopBar working hours indicator**: Replaced the "deliver to current location" mobile button with a `WorkingHoursIndicator` (`client/src/components/TopBar.tsx`) that reads `store_status`, `opening_time`, `closing_time` from `useUiSettings`, computes open/closed automatically (supports midnight crossover), and shows time in 12-hour format with Arabic ص/م suffix. Auto-refreshes every minute.
- **AdminOffers.tsx**: Converted misused `useState(() => {...})` to `useEffect`. Added `onError` toasts and proper `response.ok` checks to all three mutations (create / update / delete). Switched `validUntil` to ISO string for safer JSON serialization. Verified end-to-end with `POST /api/admin/special-offers` returning 201 with auto-linked "العروض" category.
- **Admin sidebar cleanup (AdminLayout.tsx)**: Removed three menu items whose routes had no page (would render NotFound): "تقارير المتاجر" (`/admin/restaurant-reports`), "التقارير التفصيلية" (`/admin/detailed-reports`), "التقارير المتقدمة" (`/admin/advanced-reports`).
- **Google Sign-In secret**: Requested `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` from the user (the GIS button code in `CustomerAuthPage.tsx` was already complete from a previous session and activates as soon as the env var is set).
